## REFERENCE TO STORY ABOUT SALOMO
In Kaguya-Sama Love Is War I found a possible reference to a story about Salomo, the religious figure.
In Kaguya-Sama, both Kaguya and Chika is pulling each of President Shirogane's arms. The background voice talks about an old story
where two women were fighting over who was the child's mother. They competed in tug of war with the child, but the judge, decided that the woman who let go of the
child as soon as he got in pain, was worthy of being the mother.

This is a famous story about Salomo. He judged the same way in the same scenario. I am not sure but I believe this was a reference to that story.

### Sources
I found the Salomo quote in a school book about religion. The book is in Swedish.
