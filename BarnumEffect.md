# The Barnum Effect
Frequently called the Barnum Effect or the Forer effect. Less known as the Barnum-Forer effect.

## HISTORY


## EXPLANATION
In psychology, the Barnum Effect refers to the phenomenon where people think that descriptions of their personality that is supposed to be specially made for them
are highly accurate, while actually, the descriptions are really vague and made to apply on any person.

This is the effect and explanation behind personality tests like astrology and fortune telling.

## APPLICATION/EXAMPLE
Let me use an example to explain better:
My zodiac sign is pisces and I am a male. This is the personality for a pisces male:
```
The Pisces male is inquisitive, intellectual, and wise,
but he’s also extremely guarded and secretive about his own life and particularities. He protects them intensely
and won’t let anyone in unless he fully trusts them.
```
I feel like some parts of this description fits me, but I also think that the same can be said for everyone. This description applies on almost everyone,
at least some parts of it.

If I take another sign like Libra
This is the personality of a libra male:
```
The Libra man is all about balance and saying and doing the right thing in every situation. A Libra man’s overall 
personality is such that he innately feels out every scenario before jumping in and fitting in – that’s how he works. If you’re getting to know such a person, 
then learning about a Libra man will help you understand where he’s coming from, 
at least most of the time. Overall, you’re getting to know a person who is kind, caring, polite, respectful, and motivated to achieve harmony with others.
```
Once again I feel like some parts of this description applies to me, like many other.
