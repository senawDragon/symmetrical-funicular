# symmetrical-funicular
A collection of science from different animes. Every concept is explained with sources and links for further studying.

## INTRODUCTION TO symmetrical-funicular
I am a weeb as well as a science geek. Basically your average otaku. Since first watching, I have always wanted to understand the science behind the anime called "Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It" 理系が恋に落ちたので証明してみた。
Therefore I decided I would start studying and attempting to write down everything I learn about science from anime here. Of course I will not only feature science from only one anime but instead every anime that I find has intresting science mentioned in it.

## INFO
This was made and is maintained by one person.
I am no real scientist nor a trustworthy source, therefore everything you find here about science will have trustworthy sources to back it up.
