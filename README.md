# symmetrical-funicular
A collection of science and references from different animes. Every concept and reference is explained with sources and links for further studying.

## INTRODUCTION TO symmetrical-funicular
I am a weeb as well as a science geek. Basically your average otaku. Since first watching, I have always wanted to understand the science behind the anime called "Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It" 理系が恋に落ちたので証明してみた。
Therefore I decided I would start studying and attempt to write down everything I learn about science from anime here. Of course I will not only feature science from only one anime but instead every anime that I find with intresting science.

## INFO
This was made and is maintained by one person.
I am no real scientist nor a trustworthy source, therefore everything you find here about science will have trustworthy sources to back it up.

This is an extremely time and energy consuming project especially since I am a student and I try to find references and relevant information about the science related subjects, please support this project
by simply reading it, telling your friends about it and consider giving it a star if you like it.
